<h3>Method</h3>

<p>Pad Thai Method: First make the Pad Thai sauce. You can make a big batch and keep in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
	Fry the shallots in cooking oil over medium heat until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes. Add palm sugar and tamarind paste to the shallots and mix well until the sugar is fully dissolved. Add fish sauce and dark soy sauce and cook for 2 minutes until the sauce thickens and golden brown. Set aside.
Now for the Pad Thai. Add cooking oil to the wok over medium high heat. Add eggs straight in and scramble it up. Add prawns to the half-cooked eggs and cook for about 2-3 minutes until the prawns are cooked through. Add the noodles, Pad Thai sauce and turn up to high heat. Mix well and cook for about a minute until the noodles take on the golden brown colour. Add the turnips and tofu and sti for just 30 seconds. Turn off the heat and add beansprouts and chives; I like them crunchy so the heat from the noodles will cook them just right. Serve with the garnish. </p>



<p2>Green Curry Method: Heat the oil in a saucepan over a high heat and add the curry paste. Stir-fry for 10 seconds until it is fragrant.
	Reduce the heat to medium and add half the coconut milk. Cook for about 2 minutes until the green oil splits and rises to the surface.
	Now add the remaining coconut milk. Add the sustainable palm sugar and the fish sauce, then season with a pinch of salt. Stir in the lime leaves and add the chicken to the pan. Add the pea aubergines, Thai aubergines and the bamboo shoots. Cook over a medium heat for 5–7 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the basil leaves.
	Ladle into serving bowls, garnish each one with some sliced chilli and a sprig of basil and serve with steamed rice. </p2>



<p3> Pu Nim Method: To clean the crabs, lift the shell on each side of the body and scrape out the frond-like gills. Snip off the eyes and mouth. Give the crabs a quick rinse then pat dry with a paper towel.Using a pestle and mortar, pound the coriander roots to a paste with a good pinch of salt. Add the garlic and continue to pound into a somewhat coarse paste. Remove excess or tough garlic skin then stir in the peppercorns, crushing them lightly.
Mix the flour with a large pinch of salt. Dredge the cleaned crabs with the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess, then combine them with the garlic and black pepper paste.
Pour the deep-frying oil into a large, stable wok or a wide, heavy-based pan until it is about two-thirds full. Heat the oil over a medium-high flame until a cooking thermometer registers 180°C (350°F). Alternatively, test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a cube of bread; it will brown in about 15 seconds if the oil is hot enough.
Deep-fry the crabs in the hot oil for 3-4 minutes, turning them a few times to ensure even cooking, until they are cooked and the garlic is golden. Should the garlic start to smell bitter and darken too much before the crabs are ready, quickly scoop it out. Lift out the crabs and drain on paper towels.
Sprinkle with the chopped coriander and serve with steamed rice and a small bowl of sauce Siracha. </p3>
